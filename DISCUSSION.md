If I have more time then I would:
1. Implement debouncing on the search input to reduce the number of API calls made as the user types.
2. Cache search results on the client side to avoid redundant API calls for the same search terms.
3. Add filters for specialties, years of experience, and location (e.g., dropdowns or checkboxes) so users can narrow down their search effectively.
4. Use color coding for different specialties to help users quickly identify relevant advocates.
5. Make database fields searching on (e.g., firstName, lastName, city, degree, specialties, yearsOfExperience) are indexed making speed up search queries.
6. Use MongoDB's text indexes as full-text search.
7. Implement Redis as caching store to reduce database load.
8. Implement CI/CD with Github Actions
9. Write unit testing with Jest
10. Dockerize the app

By implementing these enhancements, we can significantly improve the performance, scalability, and user experience of our application, ensuring it meets the highest standards of quality and reliability.
